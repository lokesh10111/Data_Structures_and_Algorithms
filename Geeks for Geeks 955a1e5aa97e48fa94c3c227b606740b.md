# Geeks for Geeks

Why DSA is Important?

→ Make you a better Developer

→ Keeps you in getting in job.

→ Winning the sport of Competitive Coding.

RoadMap for Data Structures:

Learn a language 

- c++ (recommended) [some time more complex syntax]
- Java (More Recommended) [more typing] for patience programmer [prefer Java]
- Python
- Javascript

Learn DSA basics and implement

learn language libraries tht ahve DSA implemented

Do practice ! Practice ! and learn together!

# Analysis of Algorithms

### backround:

Example Problems : Sum of n natural numbers

Sum of n natural numbers

input: n=3

Output: 6

## Asymptotic Analysis:

- The idea is to measure order of growth.
- Does not depend upon machine learning, programming language etc.
- No need to implement, we can analyze algorithm.
