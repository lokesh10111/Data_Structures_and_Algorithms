# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository provides a roadmap and resources for learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It will help you become a better developer, increase your job prospects, and excel in competitive coding.

## Roadmap:

1. Choose a programming language:
   - C++ (recommended)
   - Java (more recommended)
   - Python
   - JavaScript

2. Learn DSA basics and implementation.

3. Explore language libraries with DSA implementations.

4. Practice, practice, practice!

Contribute to this repository by following the guidelines and let's learn DSA together!

**Happy coding!**
