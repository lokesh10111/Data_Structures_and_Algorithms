## **What is meant by Algorithm Analysis?**

Algorithm analysis is a way to understand how much time and memory an algorithm needs to solve a particular problem. It helps us estimate the resources required by an algorithm. By analyzing algorithms, we can figure out how efficient they are and choose the most effective one for a given task.

## **Why Analysis of Algorithms is important?**

- To predict the behavior of an algorithm without implementing it on a specific computer.
- It is much more convenient to have simple measures for the efficiency of an algorithm than to implement the algorithm and test the efficiency every time a certain parameter in the underlying computer system changes.
- It is impossible to predict the exact behavior of an algorithm. There are too many influencing factors.
- The analysis is thus only an approximation; it is not perfect.
- More importantly, by analyzing different algorithms, we can compare them to determine the best one for our purpose.

## **Types of Algorithm Analysis:**

1. Best case
2. Worst case
3. Average case
